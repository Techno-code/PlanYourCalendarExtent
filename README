Hello! This is our submission for the 2022 FreyHacks Hackathon!

To test this extension (Google Chrome required): 
  1) Download the .zip file from our GitHub
  2) Go to "chrome://extensions"
  3) Unzip the file and click "Load unpacked"
  4) Select the file inside the unzipped folder with the same name as it
  5) The extension should now appear in your extensions, in the jigsaw piece at the top right of the screen, where you can interact with it
  6) If the extension does not appear, just imagine the most beautiful calendar you've ever seen, and award points based on that
